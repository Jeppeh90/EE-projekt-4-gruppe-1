% SKAL STÃ… I TOPPEN AF ALLE FILER FOR AT MASTER-filen KOMPILERES 

This report describes a third semester project at ASE in the field of Electical Engineering. The thesis is devoted to the development of a system to ensure a stable voltage level on a distribution line with varying load.

The report descibes a prototype of a voltage regulator, which can be installed on an existing distribution line. The prototype contains a simulation of a distribution line, on which the functionality of the voltage regulator is demonstrated. The voltage regulation is performed with a step transformer that changes step based on data from measurement devices placed centrally and decentrally on the distribution line. 

The project includes programming of measurement devices on PSOC, controling/regulation of the step transformer on a Siemens PLC and TCP-kommunication.
