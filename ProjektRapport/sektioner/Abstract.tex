This paper describes a $4^{th}$ semester project at Aarhus School of Engineering in the field of Electical Engineering. The thesis is devoted to the development of a system that ensures a stable voltage level on a distribution line with varying load.

The paper describes a prototype of a voltage regulator, which can be installed on an existing distribution line. The prototype contains a simulation of a distribution line, on which the functionality of the voltage regulator is demonstrated. The voltage regulation is performed with a step transformer that changes step based on data from measurement devices placed centrally and decentrally on the distribution line. 

The project includes programming of measurement devices on PSoC, controlling of the step transformer on a Siemens PLC and TCP-communication.
